# Job Level Satisfaction Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the Job Level Satisfaction Analysis project! This project is part of the Data Exploration & Modelling course for the 2024-25 academic year. The goal is to apply concepts from the course to analyze a real-world dataset on job satisfaction.

## Project Setup

1. **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project is the [Employee Survey Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/employee-survey?resource=download) from Kaggle.
2. **Environment**: Use a virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt` using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Assignment Breakdown

### Part 1: Dataset Exploration & Data Preprocessing

#### Dataset Selection
- **Criteria**: Classification or regression problem, at least 1000 instances, 10 features.
- **Chosen Dataset**: Employee Survey Dataset from Kaggle.

#### Data Preprocessing
- **Steps**:
  - Clean data, remove outliers, handle missing values.
  - Feature engineering: create and normalize new features.
  - Feature selection: remove non-contributing features.
  - Visualizations: use matplotlib and seaborn for insights.
  - Hypothesis formulation: derive and test hypotheses.

### Part 2: Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning

#### Model Building
- **Process**:
  - Build multiple machine learning models (classification/regression).
  - Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.
  - Use cross-validation for model selection.
  - Apply ensemble methods to improve performance.
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal results.

### Iterative Modelling Process
- Start with simple models and iteratively improve using more sophisticated techniques.

## Submission

- **Contents**: Dataset, Jupyter Notebooks, `requirements.txt`.
- **Submit as**: Zipped folder.

## Evaluation

- **Process**: Regular evaluations with feedback during the semester.
- **Final Grade**: Determined at the end of the term based on progress and improvements.
